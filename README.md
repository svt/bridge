## Motivation  

As developers of production software we found ourselves in a position of rebuilding tools with similar functionality and core features time and time again. Bridge is an experiment for a collection of core tools and a platform for plugins that enables reuse of the tools we build. Not only does it encourage a mix-and-match mindset where operators can choose from a selection of already built components, it cuts down on development time and enforces stability.

## Features

- [ ] HTTP Web interface for remote use
- [ ] A fully customizable grid layout
- [ ] Variables
- [¬†] Item references
- [ ] Sub-frame accurate timing
- [ ] Multi-threaded architecture
- [ ] Nested groups
- [ ] Multiple rundowns per project
- [ ] Shotbox-style buttons
- [ ] OSC API

## Compatibility notes  
- Bridge works with Caspar CG Server 2.3 and up.
